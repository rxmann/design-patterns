/**
 * ServerSocket: 
 * This is a special type of socket used for listening for incoming network requests. 
 * In our server application, it's set up to listen on a specified port.
 * 
 * ExecutorService: 
 * This manages a pool of threads. Each client is handled in a 
 * separate thread, allowing multiple clients to be serviced simultaneously.
 * 
 * Synchronized List: 
 * This is used to handle the list of client connections. 
 * It ensures that the list is thread-safe, meaning it can be modified by multiple 
 * threads without causing data corruption.
 * 
 * Infinite Loop: 
 * The server runs an infinite loop that continuously listens  for new client connections. 
 * This is typical for servers that need to handle clients at any time without a predefined limit.
