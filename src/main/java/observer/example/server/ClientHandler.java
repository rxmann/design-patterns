/**
 * Socket and Server References: 
 * Each ClientHandler holds a reference to its Socket and the Server. 
 * The Socket is used for communicating with the connected client, and the 
 * Server reference is used for interacting with server-wide operations like 
 * broadcasting messages.
 * 
 * Run Method: 
 * This method is where the main functionality of the ClientHandler lies. 
 * It reads messages from its client and uses the server's method to broadcast 
 * these messages to all connected clients. It continues to do this until it 
 * encounters an end-of-stream condition (i.e., the client disconnects).
 * 
 * Error and Connection Handling: 
 * Proper error handling and cleanup are crucial. The method includes a 
 * finally block that ensures the client's socket is closed when they disconnect 
 * or an error occurs. It also removes the ClientHandler from the server's 
 * client list to prevent memory leaks and ensure the server does not attempt to 
 * send messages to a disconnected client.
 * 
 * Broadcasting Joining and Leaving Messages: 
 * The handler automatically broadcasts messages to all clients when a 
 * user joins or leaves the chat, providing a simple notification system for 
 * user presence.
